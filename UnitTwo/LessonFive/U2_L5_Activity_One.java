/**
 * Write code which creates three circles with radius 10.1, 14 and 20.5 respectively. The code should then print the three circles, one on each line, in the order given (i.e. the one with radius 10.1 first and the one with radius 20.5 last). The output that you are printing must utilize the toString method inside Circle Class.
 * <br>
 * Sample run:
 * <pre>
 * circle with radius 10.1
 * circle with radius 14.0
 * circle with radius 20.5
 * </pre>

### Instructions

<style>
code{ color: red }
</style>

Debug the code provided in the starter file so it does the following:

* creates an Integer object named <code>sides</code>
* creates a Double object named <code>length</code>
* gets inputs from the user for each of these objects
* creates a RegularPolygon object <code>p1</code>, with the <code>sides</code> and <code>length</code> value
* creates a second RegularPolygon, <code>p2</code>, with twice the side length of <code>p1</code>, and one more side than <code>p1</code>
* prints the details and areas of <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code> on separate lines

Reference the sample run below to see what a run looks like when the code is running correctly.

Sample run:
<pre>
Enter number of sides:
> 4
Enter side length:
> 2.5
The area of a square with side length 2.5 is: 6.250000000000001
The area of a regular pentagon with side length 5.0 is: 43.01193501472417
</pre>

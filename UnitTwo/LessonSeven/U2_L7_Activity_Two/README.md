### Instructions

Debug the code provided in the starter file so it does the following:

* creates two Integer objects x and y, and initializes them as null
* prints the values of x and y (should result in the output "null null")
* sets x and y to inputs entered by the user
* finds the average of the two values and stores this in a Double value avg
* prints a sentence as shown in the sample run with the values of x, y and the average
* Hint - just as with Strings (see Unit 2: Lesson 1) we can explicitly assign any class-type variable as null just by typing <code>= null</code>

Sample run:
<pre>
null null
Enter values:
>5
>12
Average of 5 and 12 is 8.5
</pre>

## Instructions
For this exercise, fix the code with the [file](./U2_L4_Activity_One_Starter.java) provided.

The program is meant to take two string inputs, `s1` and `s2` as well as an int input represented as `n`.

After it takes the three inputs, it should print a string that is made up of the last `n` letters of `s1` and the first `n` letters of `s2`.

Fix the errors, so the program runs as expected!

Sample run
<pre>
Enter first string
cream
Enter second string
butter
Enter number of letters from each word
3
eambut
</pre>
Note: you are not expected to make your code work when n is bigger than the length of either string.

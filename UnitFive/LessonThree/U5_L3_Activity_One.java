/**
 * Write a method that takes a RegularPolygon as a parameter, and changes the number of sides so it becomes an equilateral triangle (i.e. set the number of sides to 3).
 * This method must be called makeEqTriangle() and it must take a RegularPolygon as a parameter.
 * <br>
 * You can call your method in the program's main method so you can test whether it works, but you must remove or comment out the main method before checking your code for a score.
 * <br>
 * For example, if the following code appeared in your main method:
 * <pre>
 * RegularPolygon poly = new RegularPolygon(4, 4);
 * makeEqTriangle(poly);
 * System.out.println(poly);
 * </pre>
 * Your code would output the following:
 * <pre>
 * equilateral triangle with side length 4.0
 * </pre>

/**
 * Write a method that takes a Rectangle as a parameter, sets its length to a random, even integer between 10 and 20 inclusive, and sets its width to a random, odd integer greater than or equal to 7 and less than 14. Use {@link Math#random Math.random()} to generate random numbers.
 * <br>
 * This method must be called <code>randomize()</code> and it must take a <code>Rectangle</code> parameter.
 * <br>
 * You can call your method in the program's main method so you can test whether it works, but you must remove or comment out the main method before checking your code for a score. You will also need to make sure you do not remove the import statement "import testing.Math" as this is required to check your code for a score.
 * <br>

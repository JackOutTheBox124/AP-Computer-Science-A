Create a class `Rectangle` which implements the API exactly as described in the following [Javadoc](https://coderunner.projectstem.org/docs/rectangle/index.html).

Don't forget - you will need to use the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem) to find the diagonal of the rectangle. You can find the area of a rectangle by multiplying the base and height together.

Use the runner_Rectangle file to test the methods in your class; do not add a main method to your Rectangle class.

Hint 1 - Javadoc only shows public methods, variables and constructors. You will need to add some private member variables to your Rectangle class to store the necessary information. Think carefully about what information actually needs to be stored and how this will need to be updated when methods change the state of a Rectangle object.

Hint 2 - As in the previous lesson's exercise it's helpful to add your method/constructor headers and any dummy returns needed before implementing each one properly. This will allow you to test your code using the runner class as you go along.

 * The template code provided is intended to check whether an integer entered by the user is outside of the range 50-59 (inclusive). If it is outside of this range the program should print a warning and change the number to 55. However, when using De Morgan's law to simplify this code, the programmer has made some mistakes. Can you correct the errors so the code functions as intended?
 * <br>
 * Sample runs of the program functioning properly are below:
 * <br>
 * Sample run 1:
 * <pre>
 * Enter a number in the fifties
 * 51
 * Your number is 51
 * </pre>
 * Sample run 2:
 * <pre>
 * Enter a number in the fifties
 * 33
 * That's not in the fifties!
 * Your number is 55
 * </pre>
